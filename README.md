# Sample Todo App

This is a small example app, implementing a client side todo list.

The main purpose is to test out Next.js with typescript, cypress and jest.

## Usecases

1. Users can add multiple todos in a row, todos get displayed sorted by priority and creation
    - Todos have a name, id, timestamp and an optional priority flag
    - Todos with priority are sorted to top
2. Users can delete todos
3. After reload, todos still exist
4. Users can reset the app, deleting all todos
